Prisma 1 templates for major cloud providers.

WIP.

## How to connect the Prisma 1 CLI to your custom server
* Install the Prisma CLI, e.g.: `npm install -g prisma`
* Run `prisma init` and choose `Other server`, then enter the URL to your server.
* When you `prisma deploy` a service, select the name you chose for the entry above. Your service will now be deployed to your server.
